    <p>
    ... And now, the end is near <br>
    And so I face the final curtain<br>
    My friend, I'll say it clear<br>
    I'll state my case, of which I'm certain<br>
    I've lived a life that's full<br>
    I traveled each and every highway<br>
    And more, much more than this<br>
    I did it my way<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    ... Regrets, I've had a few<br>
    But then again, too few to mention<br>
    I did what I had to do<br>
    And saw it through without exemption<br>
    I planned each charted course<br>
    Each careful step along the byway<br>
    And more, much more than this<br>
    I did it my way<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    ... Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew<br>
    When I bit off more than I could chew<br>
    But through it all, when there was doubt<br>
    I ate it up and spit it out<br>
    I faced it all, and I stood tall<br>
    And did it my way<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    ... I've loved, I've laughed and cried<br>
    I've had my fill, my share of losing<br>
    And now, as tears subside<br>
    I find it all so amusing<br>
    To think I did all that<br>
    And may I say, not in a shy way<br>
    Oh, no, oh, no, not me<br>
    I did it my way<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    ... For what is a man, what has he got?<br>
    If not himself, then he has naught<br>
    To say the things he truly feels<br>
    And not the words of one who kneels<br>
    The record shows I took the blows<br>
    And did it my way<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    ... Yes, it was my way<br>
    </p>
